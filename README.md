# LIFT-HUMAN
LIFT-HUMAN is a lightweight scheme based on LIght Field to obtain the Three-dimension HUMAN models. We present a hardware platform with a portable 100-camera array and network devices to acquire light field data and provide data processing service. Through the array we record a novel dataset, including high-quality human light field with different poses and corresponding point cloud models generated by algorithms in LIFT-HUMAN.

The dataset is available for free as long as it is used for non-commercial and research purposes. It can be downloaded from the file LightFieldHuman. The camera parameters of each industrial camera within the array is under file CalibrationResult, which may help improve the performance of 3D reconstruction process.

The LIFT-HUMAN system has already submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2023. The paper may be uploaded to the preprint website shortly. We will also contribute more data to the dataset in our future work.
