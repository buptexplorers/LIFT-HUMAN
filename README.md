# LIFT-HUMAN
LIFT-HUMAN is a lightweight scheme based on LIght Field to obtain the Three-dimension HUMAN models. We present a hardware platform with a portable 100-camera array and network devices to acquire light field data and provide data processing service. Through the array we record a novel dataset, including high-quality human light field with different poses and corresponding point cloud models generated by algorithms in LIFT-HUMAN.

The LIFT-HUMAN system has already submitted to IEEE ICCV 2023. The dataset is available for free as long as it is used for non-commercial and research purposes. It can be downloaded from the file _LightFieldHuman_. In particular, \*shape is collected by volunteers standing statically, \*pose is captured by volunteers doing exercises, and \*.ply is the construction model evaluated in our experiment. The camera parameters of each industrial camera within the array is under file _CalibrationResult_, which may help improve the performance of 3D reconstruction process.

We will also contribute more data to the dataset in our future work.
